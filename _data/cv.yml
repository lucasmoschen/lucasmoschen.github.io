      value: My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical modelling, control theory, and numerical analysis for differential equations. I am currently focused on developing optimal control methods for mean-field PDEs, such as the McKean-Vlasov and Fokker-Planck equations, with applications to large-scale stochastic systems like opinion dynamics. My previous work has explored optimal control problems in constrained systems, including epidemic models and stochastic population dynamics, with methods spanning probability, optimisation, and reinforcement learning.
