Since September 2023 I have being studying the second year of master in Sorbonne University - M2 Mathématiques de la Modélisation. 
Being in my second year as a master's student at Sorbonne University, I have already successfully concluded my master's program in Brazil. 
My academic journey has been characterized by an unwavering passion for science and mathematics, a commitment that continues to flourish within the esteemed Sorbonne University. During my studies in Brazil, I was fortunate to have [Pr. Maria Soledad Aronna](https://sites.google.com/view/aronna/home) as my advisor. She provided invaluable guidance throughout my dissertation project at the School of Applied Mathematics in Fundação Getulio Vargas, where my research focused on devising optimal vaccination strategies for epidemics in metropolitan areas, a subject that involves Optimal Control Theory and Epidemiology.

My journey in mathematics began when I was awarded my first medal at the [Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad of Public Schools (OBMEP)](http://www.obmep.org.br/), where I was exposed to a junior scientific initiation program (PIC) focused on algebra, number theory and geometry. My four-year participation in this program was instrumental in developing my passion for the field, igniting my curiosity, and sharpening my skills. 

Thanks to the opportunities and support provided by the program, I enrolled in the Applied Math Undergraduate course at FGV in 2018. Inspired by my scientific initiation and motivated by my growing interest in mathematics, I began taking master's courses in 2019, encouraged by the [Scientific Initiation and Master's Program (PICME)](https://picme.obmep.org.br/). I presented my Bachelor's Dissertation with [Pr. Luiz Max Carvalho](https://github.com/maxbiostat) at the end of 2021 working on the prevalence estimation problem in hard-to-reach populations with imperfect diagnostic tests. The [Brazilian Society of Applied Mathematics (SBMAC)](https://www.sbmac.org.br/) recognized this research as the third-best Research Initiation Project in the country in 2022. This recognition has only fueled my drive to make further strides in the field of mathematics, and I am excited about the future possibilities that lie ahead. In the final term of 2022, I also had the opportunity to visit Pr. Dante Kalise at Imperial College London to study optimal control of the Fokker-Planck equation.
