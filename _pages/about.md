I am a **PhD researcher in Mathematics** at Imperial College London, specializing in **Optimization**, **Control Theory**, and **Partial Differential Equations**. 
My research focuses on **PDE-constrained optimization**, particularly developing control methods for the **McKean-Vlasov and Fokker-Planck equations** or other PDE models that arise from diffusion processes, with applications in **physics, social sciences, and biology**.

I am currently funded by the **Roth PhD Scholarship** under the **CNRS-Imperial Joint Program**, and have received previous academic awards, including the **PGSM Master Scholarship**, the **PICME Scholarship**, and support from the **CDMC Talent Program** during my academic journey

My enthusiasm for mathematics initiated early on, earning my first recognition at the [Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad of Public Schools (OBMEP)](http://www.obmep.org.br/), where I was exposed to a junior scientific initiation program (PIC) focused on algebra, number theory and geometry.

During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of working with all my supervisos on diverse topics in optimal control, epidemiology, PDE, and statatistics, with a focus on improving methods in Applied Mathematics.
