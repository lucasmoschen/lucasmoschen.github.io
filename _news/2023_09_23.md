I'm thrilled to announce my attendance at the 10th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Heidelberg (Germany).
This prestigious event gathers 200 students in Mathematics and Computer Science from across the globe, alongside distinguished laureates recognized for their contributions to these fields. 
This compelling networking event combines scientific, social and outreach activities in a unique atmosphere, sustained by comprehensive exchange and scientific inspiration.
