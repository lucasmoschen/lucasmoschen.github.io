The PGMODays 2023, organized by Hadamard Foundation, kicks off today at EDF Lab Paris-Saclay in Palaiseau, France. 
This conference brings together researchers in Optimization to share and discuss the latest advances in the field. 
I am excited to present the research conducted with Professor Maria Soledad Aronna on developing optimal vaccination strategies for metropolitan areas.
