Book written in portuguese, our native language, by the class about some classic topics in [Discrete Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en/discipline/graduacao-matematica-aplicada-graduacao-ciencia-de-dados/discrete-mathematics) and applied in Lean Theorem Prover. 
It was our final project in the course. 

The book was based majorly in the main reference of the course: the book [Logic and Proof](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/). 
The idea is to build important topics in the area using a Theorem Proof, in special the Lean. 
It was an interesting team project with several difficulties in the process. 

The project was organized as follow: each chapter of the original book was designated for a group or a person and that person had to structure it, write it in portuguese, create additional examples and program all in Lean, explaining the code.

- Introduction: general description, deductive systems and provers, as Lean.
- Lean: description of the language used through the book.

  $$\rightarrow$$, $$\neg$$ or $$\lor$$.
- First Order Logic: syntax and semantics.
- Sets: foundations, properties and theorems.
