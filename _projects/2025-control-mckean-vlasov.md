This project investigates fast stabilization techniques for the McKean-Vlasov equation, a mean-field PDE describing the evolution of interacting particle systems. The focus is on constructing efficient control strategies to drive solutions toward equilibrium while minimizing computational cost. The approach combines optimal control theory, feedback stabilization, and numerical methods to develop practical schemes for large-scale systems. Potential applications include consensus dynamics, swarming behavior, and mean-field games.
