This work in progress with [Maria Soledad Aronna](https://sites.google.com/view/aronna/home) is part of the requirements for obtaining a Master's degree in Mathematical Modelling at the School of Applied Mathematics of Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV/EMAp). 

Epidemic models are mathematical frameworks used to study the spread and control of infectious diseases within populations.
One particular approach is the use of compartments that divide the population in subgroups, such as susceptibles, infected and recovered. 
This model assumes that the group has a good mixing, but in the context of a larger population, it may be interesting to subdivide these groups.
For that, metapopulations refer to a collection of interconnected subpopulations that exchange individuals over time through a contact matrix. 
This is relevant because disease transmission can occur not only within a subpopulation but also between subpopulations. 
Moreover, each subpopulation may have different characteristics such as the contact rate.
In order to prevent worst outbreaks, the use of vaccination as a control method is an effective way to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. 
These models allow for the assessment of different vaccination strategies and their impact on disease transmission, as well as the identification of the most effective control methods for specific populations.
We study this models and consider them important tools in predicting and managing disease outbreaks.
