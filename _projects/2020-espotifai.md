Study of the playlist continuation problem and implementation of automatic recommendation algorithms to deal with it. 
It was our final project for subject [Fundamentals of Data Science](https://emap.fgv.br/en/discipline/mestrado/fundamentals-data-science). 
[Lucas Resck](https://github.com/lucasresck) was my partner in the development. 

## Abstract

This repository contains our approach to the playlist continuation problem. 
We collected data from Spotify and Last.fm and we did an exploratory data analysis. We also implemented playlist continuation models and we have seen good results. 
We developed a website to expose our work.
