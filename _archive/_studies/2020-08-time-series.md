Time series is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. Mathematically,
a time series is a stochastic process with a discrete-time observation
support. In this repository, we study several topics, such as ARIMA models,
trend and seasonality. 
Each homework has a practical simulation and some theoretical questions.

The homeworks and assignments are coded in R language and the presentations
and texts are in portuguese.
