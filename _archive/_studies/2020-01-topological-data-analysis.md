Abstract
---

This was a summer course given by professor R. Tinarrage at School of Applied
Mathematics, Getulio Vargas Foundation. The purpose was build the essencial
and basic tools from Topology until we develop the persistency homology
theory. There were some shortcuts since the duration of the program. Among the
topics we emphasize homeomorphisms and homotopies, simplicial complexes,
homology groups, betti curves, decomposition of persistency modules, stability
and applications. Some of these concepts were studied using Python Programming
Language through three tutorials. You can check the summary in my repository.

Along the notes written by the professor, several exercises were suggested and
the answers can be found in the file below. All the solutions were written by me.
