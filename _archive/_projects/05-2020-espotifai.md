Study of the playlist continuation problem and implementation of automatic
recommendation algorithms to deal with it. It was our final project for
subject [Fundamentals of Data Science](https://emap.fgv.br/en/discipline/mestrado/fundamentals-data-science).
[Lucas Domingues](https://github.com/lucasresck) was my partner in the
development. 

Abstract 
---

This repository contains our approach to the playlist continuation problem. We
collected data from Spotify and Last.fm and we did an exploratory data
analysis. We also implemented playlist continuation models and we have seen good
results. We developed a website to expose our work.
