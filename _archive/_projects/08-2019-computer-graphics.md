Project developed for the final evaluation of the [Introduction to Computer Graphics](https://emap.fgv.br/en/discipline/graduacao-matematica-aplicada/introduction-computer-graphics)'
course about correction with B-Cell image histograms obtained by
transmission electron microscopy.

Abstract 
---

In this work I studied the B lymphocytes, white blood cells responsible for making
antibodies. They can differentiate in different types by changing its
structure so as to have a specific function for the system. This analysis can be helped by
graphic tools, so we obtain the images using the transmission electron
microscope, given that photo with light is not viable since they are tiny. 
After taking the images, image processing 
is necessary and histogram analysis is considered quite relevant to equalize
images and be able to compare them. The coloring histograms provide a lot of
information about the image, such as contrast and image acquisition problems. 
Theoretical texts about the topic were read and simulations made in *javascript* were used
to develop the website. The problem of threshold was analysed either.

The work is well explained in the original website (in portuguese, can be
translated).
